# 🧠 Reput3: A Modular, Verifiable Reputation Layer for Web3

> zk-verified. AVS-attested. Sybil-resistant. The onchain “LinkedIn for builders.”

---

## ✨ Overview

Reput3 is a modular, privacy-preserving **onchain reputation protocol** that enables developers, contributors, and DAOs to establish, verify, and consume **credible contributor identities** across the Web3 ecosystem.

Built using **zero-knowledge proofs**, **EigenLayer AVS attestation**, and cross-protocol data aggregation, Reput3 helps DAOs, protocols, and grants platforms distinguish signal from noise.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Web3 lacks a **trustless and standardized** way to verify contributor identity and credibility. Today, projects rely on:

- Centralized GitHub links
- Off-chain CVs or social presence
- Manual reviews (slow, biased, sybil-prone)

This hurts capital allocation, makes sybil resistance difficult, and discourages anonymous but skilled contributors.

---

## 🛠️ Solution

Reput3 solves this by offering:

✅ **Aggregated Contributor Data**  
From GitHub, smart contracts, DAOs, POAPs, and protocol-specific credentials

✅ **zk-Verifiable Reputation Proofs**  
Users generate **privacy-preserving ZK credentials** of their onchain + offchain activity

✅ **AVS-backed Attestation**  
Uses **EigenLayer AVS nodes** for decentralized validation and optional slashing

✅ **Composable Reputation Scores**  
DAOs and platforms can plug in to filter contributors, enable sybil resistance, or power decentralized grants

---

## 🧱 Architecture

- **zk-SNARKs** → Used to prove activity (e.g. GitHub commits, DAO votes) without exposing metadata
- **EigenLayer AVS** → Validators attest to credential validity, can be slashed for false attestations
- **DID Integration** → Optional support for Sismo, KILT, or ENS to establish cross-wallet identities
- **Modular Scoring** → Scores built on customizable weights and categories (code, governance, education, etc.)

---

## 👤 Target Users

- **DAOs** seeking credible contributors
- **Grant Platforms** trying to prevent sybil attacks
- **Protocol Teams** hiring builders or validators
- **Developers** building a verifiable Web3 resume

---

## 💰 Business Model

- **Free for individuals** to create and own their identity
- **Premium APIs** for DAOs and platforms to query/filter contributors
- **White-label SDK** for grant platforms to integrate scoring logic
- Future tokenized incentive layer for slashing and validation staking
